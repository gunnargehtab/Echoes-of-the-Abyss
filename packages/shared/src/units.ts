/**
 * Prototype unit roster, transcribed from docs/units.md.
 *
 * SIG is a triple (idle / cruise / firing burst) because a unit's loudness is a
 * function of what it is doing, not what it is — that is the whole premise of
 * the Echo Layer.
 *
 * The `hyd` figures are SPEC — authored per unit in docs/units.md (issue #35),
 * alongside the design note there settling that HYD is a flat hull property
 * (Silent Running changes SIG, never hearing) and that the Directorate's
 * listening doctrine is carried by these numbers rather than a special case.
