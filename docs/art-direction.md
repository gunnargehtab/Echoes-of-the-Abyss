# Echoes of the Abyss — Art Direction Guide

*(Industrial, claustrophobic, pressure-scarred — but fully original. Dieselpunk meets abyssal sci-fi.)*

## Visual Identity Overview

The art direction should communicate three things instantly:

1. **Depth** — crushing pressure, darkness, bioluminescent life
2. **Industry** — welded steel, pipes, ballast tanks, cavitation scars
3. **Conflict** — factions with distinct philosophies expressed visually

## World Aesthetic

### Color Palette

- Deep blues, blacks — abyssal trenches
- Rust orange, iron grey — industrial mining zones
- Toxic green, algae teal — kelp forests and bio-tech factions
- Volcanic red, magma gold — geothermal vent regions
- Violet resonance — Hadron territory

Use gradients to show depth: dark → darker → pitch black → bioluminescent highlights.

### Lighting

- Hard rim lights on subs
- Soft volumetric fog in trenches
- Bioluminescent flora/fauna as natural light sources
- Flickering industrial lamps in bases

### Environmental Shapes

- Jagged rock formations
- Smooth pressure-eroded stone
- Coral ruins with geometric patterns
- Massive industrial structures anchored to the seabed

## Faction Art Styles

Each faction has a full visual identity sheet (silhouette language, materials, palette, FX, UI, environmental presence, doctrine) in [factions.md](factions.md). Reference palette:

| Faction | Shapes | Palette | Silhouette |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bathyarch Consortium | Boxy, riveted, over-engineered rectangles and cylinders | `#F2B233` hazard amber · `#8C8378` iron grey · `#3D2B1F` oxide brown · `#0E1418` hull black | Heavy, slow, angular — visibly patchworked repairs |
| Pelagia Commune | Organic, curved, asymmetric — leaves, seed-pods, swimming things | `#1FA67A` algae teal · `#8FE36B` bioluminescent green · `#E8F0A3` spore pale · `#0B241E` deep chlorophyll | Sleek, stealthy — bioluminescence pulses with unit health |
| Abyssal Directorate | Spiked, insectoid, chitinous — crustacean, segmented, many-limbed | `#7A1B2E` abyssal red · `#2D1B3D` bruise violet · `#0A0710` trench black · `#C2465E` biolight crimson | Grown yet disciplined — organic forms in rigid formation |
| Hadron Knights | Symmetrical, blade-like, crystalline — instruments and blades | `#8B5CF6` resonance violet · `#E6E9F2` alloy white · `#3B2E5A` shadow indigo · `#C9A6FF` crystal glow | Elite, precise, mirror-finish — the only faction with true bilateral symmetry |

## Concept Art — Pressure Cartography

Four survey plates establish the visual language: **the discipline of measuring things that resist measurement.**

| Plate | Subject |
|---|---|
| [I — Depth Strata](concept-art/plate-01-depth-strata.png) | Vertical cross-section, propagation field, the Mouth |
| [II — Four Powers](concept-art/plate-02-four-powers.png) | Shape language, palettes, silhouettes, signature doctrine |
| [III — The Echo Layer](concept-art/plate-03-echo-layer.png) | Resolution tiers and the cost of the ping |
| [IV — The Mouth](concept-art/plate-04-the-mouth.png) | Concentric banding, return anomaly, unresolved |

## Unit Art Direction

### Silhouette Rules

- Every faction must be recognizable at a glance
- Exaggerated shapes for readability
- RTS readability > realism
- Strong rim lighting

### Animation Style

- Sub movement: slow acceleration, cavitation trails
- Drones: quick darting motions
- Siege subs: heavy recoil animations
- Bio-units: pulsing, undulating movement

### FX Language

- **Pressure weapons:** shockwaves, distortion rings
- **Sonic disruptors:** vibrating air bubbles
- **Thermal lances:** molten particle beams
- **Organic torpedoes:** glowing spores

## Building & Base Art Direction

### Construction Style

- Modular pieces that snap together
- Pressure domes with visible reinforcement
- Pipes, ballast tanks, external wiring
- Faction-specific architecture language

### Base Identity

- Bathyarch: industrial rigs, cranes, mining drills
- Pelagia: coral towers, algae farms, bio-reactors
- Abyssal: trench fortresses, chitin walls
- Hadron: magnetic pylons, resonance towers

## UI Direction

### Style

- Transparent glass panels
- Soft blue holographic overlays
- Pressure gauge motifs
- Sonar-inspired minimap

### Fonts

- Angular industrial font for Bathyarch
- Soft rounded font for Pelagia
- Sharp serif font for Hadron
- Blocky military font for Abyssal

### UI FX

- Sonar pings
- Pressure warnings
- Cavitation distortion on damage

### Echo Layer Requirements

The Echo Layer (see [systems-echo.md](systems-echo.md)) only works if it's readable at a glance:

- The minimap is a **sonar scope**, not a map — contacts render as returns with tier-appropriate fidelity
- The player's own Acoustic Signature is a permanent HUD element: a horizontal meter, always visible, colour-shifting amber → red
- Selected-unit detection radius renders as a soft ring on the terrain
- Ping cost is previewed before commit — hovering the ping button shows the 2,400 m reveal radius in threat-red
- Audio mix is the primary channel: a Tier-1 contact should be *heard* before it is *seen* on the minimap

## Atmosphere & Mood

### Key Mood Words

Claustrophobic, industrial, oppressive, bioluminescent, cold, metallic, alien.

### Camera & Composition

- Slight vignette to simulate depth
- Slow camera sway (submarine feel)
- Fog layers for parallax depth

## Cutscene & Narrative Art Direction

### Style

- 2D animated panels with parallax
- Heavy shadows
- Minimal color
- Strong silhouettes

### Mood

- Political tension
- Resource scarcity
- Environmental collapse
- Faction propaganda
